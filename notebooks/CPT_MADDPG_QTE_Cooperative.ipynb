        "# MADDPG with CPT Integral-Based Actor Updates in a Cooperative Multi-Agent Environment\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This Python script implements the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for agents in a cooperative multi-agent task, typically \"simple_spread.\" The central innovation is the application of a Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) valuation mechanism, specifically using a **CPT integral over empirical return distributions**, to modify the actor's (policy) loss function for *all* participating agents. This approach aims to guide policy updates based on a CPT-consistent valuation of the observed outcomes from batches of experience, rather than relying solely on instantaneous or expected Q-values.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Environment: Cooperative Navigation (\"simple_spread\")\n",
        "\n",
        "The agents operate in a continuous multi-agent environment:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Task:** The \"simple_spread\" scenario from `VmasEnv` (or `PettingZooEnv`). Agents cooperatively try to cover landmarks while minimizing collisions.\n",
        "* **Standard Grouping:** Unlike one of the previous cooperative scripts, this one appears to use the default environment grouping (e.g., a single \"agents\" group encompassing all agents), meaning all agents within this group will share the same CPT-modified loss structure.\n",
        "* **Observations & Actions:** Standard for \"simple_spread\" – local observations (positions, velocities, relative entity locations) and continuous actions (velocity commands).\n",
        "* **Rewards:** Based on cooperative task performance (proximity to landmarks, collision penalties).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Core Algorithm: MADDPG\n",
        "\n",
        "The foundational reinforcement learning framework is **MADDPG**:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Actor-Critic Architecture:** Each agent (or the collective group, depending on parameter sharing) has actor networks (policies) and critic networks.\n",
        "* **Centralized Critic:** The critic typically has access to more global information (observations and actions of multiple agents) to stabilize Q-value learning.\n",
        "* **Decentralized Execution:** Actors make decisions based on their local observations.\n",
        "* **Experience Replay & Soft Target Updates:** Standard DDPG components for stable and efficient learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Key Innovation: CPT Integral for Actor Loss Modification\n",
        "\n",
        "All agents in this setup utilize a CPT-modified DDPG loss, with the primary modification in the actor's loss calculation:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Utility Functions (`u_plus`, `u_minus`):**\n",
        "    * Global functions are defined to transform monetary outcomes (rewards) into subjective utilities: $u_+(x) = x^\\alpha$ for gains and $u_-(x) = \\lambda(-x)^\\alpha$ for losses.\n",
        "    * These incorporate fixed parameters for utility curvature (`alpha`) and loss aversion (`lambda`).\n",
        "    * *Important Note:* While these utility functions are defined, the current implementation of `compute_cpt_integral` (which is used in the actor loss) takes `trajectory_utilities` as input. For these `u_plus` and `u_minus` functions to affect the CPT integral, the `final_returns` passed to `compute_cpt_integral` would need to be pre-processed by these utility functions. As it stands, `compute_cpt_integral` operates on the raw returns.\n",
        "* **Piecewise Linear Probability Weighting Function (`w_approx_aux`, `w_approx`):**\n",
        "    * This script employs a flexible piecewise linear probability weighting function, $w(p)$.\n",
        "    * The function `w_approx_aux(L, x)` takes a list of parameters `L` (defining slopes, intercepts, and breakpoints) and a probability `x` to return the decision weight $w(x)$.\n",
        "* **CPT Integral (`compute_cpt_integral`):**\n",
        "    * This function calculates the CPT value of a distribution of outcomes (specifically, the `final_returns` or episode rewards from the terminal states in the current training batch).\n",
        "    * It uses the provided piecewise linear weighting function parameters `w` (a tuple `(function_type, L_params)`).\n",
        "    * The integral is computed by segmenting the observed returns and summing the products of (outcome differences) and (decision weights of exceeding those outcomes).\n",
        "* **Custom DDPG Loss (`CPTDDPGLoss` for all agents):**\n",
        "    * **Actor Loss (`loss_actor`):**\n",
        "        * A `phi_factor` is computed by calling `compute_cpt_integral` with the `final_returns` from the batch (for the specific agent group) and the predefined piecewise linear weighting function parameters `self.w`.\n",
        "        * The actor's loss is then scaled using this `phi_factor`: `loss_actor = - (torch.exp(beta * phi_factor) * Q_values).mean()`. Here, `Q_values` are the critic's evaluation of the current policy's actions. This modification encourages the policy to take actions that lead to distributions of returns deemed favorable by the CPT integral valuation.\n",
        "    * **Value Loss (`loss_value`):**\n",
        "        * **Critically, the critic is trained using the standard DDPG target value.** The CPT value transformation (`C_transform`) is defined in the script but is *not* applied to the `target_value` in the critic's loss calculation within `CPTDDPGLoss`. This means the critic learns to predict standard expected Q-values, while the actor's policy is skewed by the CPT integral's valuation of outcome distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Experimenting with CPT Hyperparameters\n",
        "\n",
        "To explore different behavioral assumptions for the CPT-driven agents, you can adjust:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Utility Function Parameters (`alpha`, `lambda` in `u_plus`, `u_minus`):**\n",
        "    * As noted above, to make these effective in the current `loss_actor` via `compute_cpt_integral`, you would need to first transform the `final_returns` using `u_plus` and `u_minus` before they are passed into `compute_cpt_integral`.\n",
        "    * **`alpha` (Utility Curvature):** Controls risk attitude.\n",
        "    * **`lambda` (Loss Aversion):** Controls the relative impact of losses versus gains.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Piecewise Linear Weighting Function Parameters (`L` for `w_approx`):**\n",
        "    * This is the most direct way to shape the CPT influence in the current actor loss. The `L` parameter list is passed to `CPTDDPGLoss` during its initialization:\n",
        "        ```python\n",
        "        loss_module = CPTDDPGLoss(\n",
        "            # ...\n",
        "            w=(0, [1.946..., 0., 0.696..., ..., 0.904...]) # The list is L_params\n",
        "        )\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "    * **Structure of `L`:** `L = [s_1, i_1, ..., s_n, i_n, bp_1, ..., bp_{n-1}]` (slopes, intercepts, breakpoints).\n",
        "    * **Experimentation:**\n",
        "        * Modify the number of segments, slopes, intercepts, and breakpoints to create various probability weighting shapes (e.g., identity, overweighting small probabilities, inverse S-shape).\n",
        "        * Ensure $w(0)=0$ and $w(1)=1$ for a coherent weighting function.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Beta in Actor Loss (`beta`):**\n",
        "    * The `beta` in `scale_factor = torch.exp(beta * phi_factor)` controls the sensitivity of the actor's loss to the CPT-derived `phi_factor`.\n",
        "    * Higher `beta` implies a stronger influence of the CPT valuation. `beta = 0` would effectively remove the CPT scaling from the actor loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "By adjusting these parameters, particularly the `L` list for the weighting function and the `beta` scaling factor, you can investigate how different CPT-based valuations of outcome distributions influence the learned cooperative strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Goal of the Code\n",
        "\n",
        "This script aims to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Implement MADDPG in a cooperative \"simple_spread\" environment where all agents' policies are influenced by a CPT integral valuation.\n",
        "* Investigate how shaping the actor's learning objective with a CPT integral (reflecting a sophisticated valuation of empirical outcome distributions) affects cooperative behavior.\n",
        "* Explore the impact of different piecewise linear probability weighting functions on the learned policies and team performance.\n",
        "* Understand the interplay between standard Q-value estimation by the critic and CPT-influenced policy optimization by the actor.\n"
